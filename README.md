Hello! I'm potatopplking. My interests span far and wide, maybe too wide, actually: computer science, physics, chemistry, biology, motorcycle riding (and repairing afterwards), hiking and camping... one life seems too short to explore and learn everything the world has to offer.

I'm not all that active here, but my hope is that someday, some of my work will be of use to somebody :) if it is, I'll be glad to hear it! You can reach me via e-mail as potatopplking at proton.me.
